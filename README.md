## Proteomics bioinformatics

### Mass spectrometry
- MS plays a central role for high-throughput proteomics.
- Review of how MS works.


### Peptide mass finderprinting

- Using the free [Matrix Science Mascot server](http://www.matrixscience.com/search_form_select.html)
- PMF input data. Serach the data against the human database using
  trypsin and setting 0 missed cleavages

- What protein do you identify? Verify that you recover the masses in
  the input.

### MSMS search

- Download the [input data](./test.mgf) (in [mgf
  format](http://www.matrixscience.com/help/data_file_help.html)) and
  familiarise yourself with it.
- Plot (by hand if you prefer) one of these MSMS spectra. The smallest
  one is peak the 234th spectrum in the file (search for
  `TITLE=13161`).
- Run an MSMS search using the free [Matrix Science Mascot
  server](http://www.matrixscience.com/search_form_select.html). Use
  the following [data](./test.mgf), which is (part of) a MSMS run from
  a single protein band extracted from a gel.
- Use the following search parameters: Instrument *ESI-TRAP*, variable
  modification *oxidation*, search databases *contaminants and
  SwissProt*, enzyme *Trypsin* with up to 1 mis-cleavage, taxonomy
  *Homo sapiens*.
- Interpet the results: what proteins have been identified? Which one
  do you think was the one in the gel band? Why do you find more than
  one protein?

- The top hit above has been cut out of a unique gel band. It has been
  produced in vivo in an engineered *E. coli* strand. Repeat the
  search without the taxonomic group. What can you say?
